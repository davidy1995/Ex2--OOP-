# Ex2  OOP Java - Threads

Third project in OOP course at Ariel Univeristy using java. This project was split into 2 parts.



## Part I - Ex2_1 Class
This class contains 4 functions: createTextFiles,getNumOfLines,getNumOfLinesThreads and getNumOfLinesThreadPool
In general - We've asked to create several text files and calculate the total
number of lines in these files. We  useed three methods - without using threads, using threads and using threadpool.
Lets have a look on the UML diagram we've created for this project.
